# Spark_Journey

This repository contains my journey through learning apache spark. For now, I go throw the book "Spark The Definitive Guide" all codes in this part are available under package `saied.spark`, which is arranged day by day as I go through.
Later on, I will plan to do some real-world projects involving some libraries such as MLlib, GrapghX...

**Day1:** Introduction to spark. overview of different API's and end-to-end example

**Day2:** getting an overview of unmentioned Tools and APIs such as spark streaming and MLlib also do some additional example of MLlib.

**Day3:** Structured API Overview and how codes spark transform codes into what will physically execute on the cluster.this was mostly theoretical.

**Day4,5:** this was mostly Basic Structured Operations and different kinds of loading dataframes,getting started with dataFrame transformations and different fucntion and how they works

**Day6:** experimenting different transformations: Renaming Columns,Removing Columns,Changing a Columnâ€™s Type (cast),Filtering Rows,Getting Unique Rows,Random Samples and Split, Concatenating and Appending Rows,Sorting Rows
